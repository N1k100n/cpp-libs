        <h1>Input/output stream library</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The &lt;iostream&gt; header provides a way to perform input and output operations in C++. It
            defines a number of classes and objects that can be used to read from and write to various
            streams, such as the standard input stream (<code>std::cin</code>), the standard output stream
            (<code>std::cout</code>), and the standard error stream (<code>std::cerr</code>). The iostream
            library is based on the concept of streams, which are sequences of characters that can be
            read from or written to.</p>

        <h2>Key components in &lt;iostream&gt;</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Streams:</b> Sequences of characters that can be read from or written to, such as the
                standard input stream, the standard output stream, and files.</li>
            <li><b>Classes:</b> Classes that represent streams and provide methods for performing input and
                output operations, such as <code>std::istream</code> (for input streams),
                <code>std::ostream</code> (for output streams), and <code>std::iostream</code> (for input/output
                streams).</li>
            <li><b>Objects:</b> Objects of the classes defined in &lt;iostream&gt; that are used to read from and
                write to specific streams, such as <code>std::cin</code>, <code>std::cout</code>, and
                <code>std::cerr</code>.</li>
            <li><b>Manipulators:</b> Functions that can be used to format input and output, such as
                <code>std::endl</code> (for inserting a newline character and flushing the output stream),
                <code>std::setw</code> (for setting the width of an output field), and <code>std::setprecision</code>
                (for setting the precision of floating-point numbers).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to use &lt;iostream&gt;</h3>
        <p>To use &lt;iostream&gt;, you need to include the &lt;iostream&gt; header file. You can then use the
            classes and objects defined in &lt;iostream&gt; to perform input and output operations.</p>

        <h3>Example: Reading from the standard input stream</h3>
        <pre><code class="cpp">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

int main() {
    std::string name;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Enter your name: ";
    std::cin &gt;&gt; name;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, " &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; "!" &lt;&lt; std::endl;

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

        <h3>Example: Writing to the standard output stream</h3>
        <pre><code class="cpp">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
    int age = 30;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "I am " &lt;&lt; age &lt;&lt; " years old." &lt;&lt; std::endl;

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

        <h3>When to use &lt;iostream&gt;</h3>
        <p>&lt;iostream&gt; is useful whenever you need to perform input or output operations in C++. It
            provides a number of tools that can be used to read from and write to various streams, such as
            the standard input stream, the standard output stream, and files. It is often used in
            conjunction with the &lt;fstream&gt; header, which provides a way to work with files.</p>

        <p>It's important to be aware of the different classes and objects that are defined in &lt;iostream&gt;,
            as well as the various manipulators that can be used to format input and output. Some of the most
            commonly used components include <code>std::cin</code>, <code>std::cout</code>, <code>std::cerr</code>,
            <code>std::endl</code>, <code>std::setw</code>, and <code>std::setprecision</code>.</p>
