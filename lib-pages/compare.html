        <h1>Comparison library (C++20)</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The &lt;compare&gt; library was introduced in C++20 to provide a standardized way to perform comparisons between
            objects. It introduces the concept of three-way comparison and provides tools for generating comparison
            operators automatically.</p>

        <h2>Key benefits of using &lt;compare&gt;</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Simplified code:</b> The library provides a way to automatically generate comparison operators,
                reducing the amount of boilerplate code you need to write.</li>
            <li><b>Improved consistency:</b> By using the library's tools, you can ensure that your comparison operators
                are consistent and correct.</li>
            <li><b>Support for three-way comparison:</b> The library introduces the concept of three-way comparison,
                which can provide more information about the relationship between two objects than traditional
                two-way comparisons.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Three-way comparison</h3>
        <p>The &lt;compare&gt; library introduces the <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> operator, also known as the spaceship operator,
            which performs a three-way comparison between two objects. The result of this operator is a
            <code>std::strong_ordering</code>, <code>std::weak_ordering</code>, or <code>std::partial_ordering</code> object,
            which indicates the relationship between the two objects.</p>

        <h3>Generating comparison operators</h3>
        <p>The &lt;compare&gt; library provides tools for automatically generating comparison operators based on the
            <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> operator. This can significantly reduce the amount of code you need to write to
            support comparisons in your classes.</p>

        <h3>Example: Using &lt;compare&gt; with a custom class</h3>
        <pre><code class="cpp">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;compare&gt;

struct MyClass {
    int value;

    auto operator&lt;=&gt;(const MyClass&amp; other) const {
        return value &lt;=&gt; other.value;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass a{1};
    MyClass b{2};

    if (a &lt; b) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "a is less than b" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }

    if (a == b) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "a is equal to b" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }

    if (a &gt; b) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "a is greater than b" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

        <h3>Ordering categories</h3>
        <p>The &lt;compare&gt; library defines three ordering categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>std::strong_ordering</code>: Represents a total order, where all elements are comparable.</li>
            <li><code>std::weak_ordering</code>: Represents a partial order, where some elements may not be comparable.
            </li>
            <li><code>std::partial_ordering</code>: Represents a partial order, where some elements may not be comparable.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The choice of ordering category depends on the specific requirements of your class and the nature of the
            data it represents.</p>
