    <h1>Concepts library</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The concepts library provides definitions of fundamental library concepts that can be used to
      perform compile-time validation of template arguments and perform function dispatch based on
      properties of types. These concepts provide a foundation for equational reasoning in programs.
      Most concepts in the standard library impose both syntactic and semantic requirements. It is
      said that a standard concept is satisfied if its syntactic requirements are met, and is modeled
      if it is satisfied and its semantic requirements (if any) are also met.
      In general, only the syntactic requirements can be checked by the compiler. If the validity or
      meaning of a program depends whether a sequence of template arguments models a concept, and the
      concept is satisfied but not modeled, or if a semantic requirement is not met at the point of use,
      the program is ill-formed, no diagnostic required.</p>
