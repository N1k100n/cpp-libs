    <h1>std::bitset</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The class template bitset represents a fixed-size sequence of N bits.
      Bitsets can be manipulated by standard logic operators and converted to
      and from strings and integers. For the purpose of the string representation
      and of naming directions for shift operations, the sequence is thought of as
      having its lowest indexed elements at the right, as in the binary representation
      of integers.</p>
